The derived virtual function `print` try to call the base version in its function body, but without the scope operator, the call will be resolved at run time as a call to the derived version itself, resulting in an infinite recursion.

To fix this problem, we need to prefix the scope operator to the call like `base::print(os);`.
简单来说就是——
在继承的类中override的虚函数如果想使用基类的override前的函数必须要加上作用域::否则会导致对自身的无限递归调用
